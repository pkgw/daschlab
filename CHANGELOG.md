# daschlab 1.0.0 (2024-12-30)

For DASCH Data Release 7, we are releasing *daschlab* version 1.0! There are not
actually many code changes relative to the previous version, though:

- Work around limitations with parsing times for versions of Python before 3.11
  (reported by Zhengjie Tian on the mailing list).
- Require the latest versions of pywwt and toasty, to ensure that we can
  display DASCH cutout images. The latest pywwt version adds a workaround for
  a bug in the supporting `reproject` package.
- Try to improve some diagnostics.
- Tidy up the documentation a bit.

The DOI of this release is [10.5281/zenodo.14574817][vdoi].
